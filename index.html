<h1>Resources for New Production Editors</h1>
<h2>Commonly Used Terms</h2>
<p>Here are some of the commonly used terms/names at O'Reilly:</p>
<dl>
	<dt>FTP Date</dt>
	<dd>Files to Printer Date. The date that you send the completed book to the printer. The "last FTP date" is the last date of the month that you can send a book to the printer and have it released that same month.</dd>
	<dt>OTD</dt>
	<dd>Out the Door. A final review performed by a senior member of the production staff. Usually done the day before the FTP date. About a week before the FTP date, send a request to <em class="email">otd@oreilly.com</em> asking for someone to do the OTD.</dd>
	<dt>Touchstone</dt>
	<dd>Touchstone is the shared server at O'Reilly, and is accessed via the command line. You will need to log onto Touchstone to perform some functions.</dd>
	<dt>SVN</dt>
	<dd>Subversion. This is a version control system that is used to hold covers, PDFs, and a few other things. This will mostly be used during Post-Production.</dd>
	<dt>Intake</dt>
	<dd>Intake is process during which the Tools team takes the content submitted by the editor and makes it production ready. This is generally the first phase of production, and is started automatically once a book arrives in Production. Once it's done, Tools will send an email with any relevant notes.</dd>
	<dt>Conversion</dt>
	<dd>Conversion is the process in which books written in MS Word are converted into HTML and imported into Atlas. Unlike Intake, this is usually done after the Copyedit phase.</dt>

<h3>Printer Info</h3>
<p>Most O'Reilly books are printed at LSI. Some books requiring more advanced color printing go elsewhere. Once a book is ready, the production editor sends the interior PDF and the cover PDF to the printer. These links detail how to send books to the different printers.</p>
<p><a href="https://intranet.oreilly.com/confluence/display/DCPS/Sending+LSI+Files+to+CoreSource">Sending LSI Files to CoreSource</a>: this is how to send books to LSI</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
<p><a href="https://intranet.oreilly.com/confluence/display/DCPS/PitStop+Profiles">PitStop Profiles</a>: a list of commonly used PitStop profiles. PitStop profiles are scripts you can run on a PDF using the command line that will change the color or alter the trim size. This is usually done in order to meet printer specifications.
